    <p> My SSTC with inspiration from the designs of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@LabCoatz_Science">Labcoatz</a>. This was my first real high voltage project and it was a great introduction to that world.

    <p> My LED Tetris board was a fun project I did for a final at Harvard Summer School. The YouTube channel "ELECTRONOOBS" provided a great guide about doing something similar. Had many problems with controlling the LEDs, but nothing impossible.

    <p> The haptic pen we were able to connect to the SPM, along with the surface topography (red dot signifies pen position). Undoubtedly the hardest project I've ever be part of.
